The _alternation_ "**|**" is a metacharacter for write regular expression.

It is the _OR_ boolean logic because allows the the choise between one of substrings:
```
   /stringa_1|stringa_2|stringa_3/

```

## PROBLEM
Write three different regex (each for row of the file to test) that match only this tree words:
_a**cc**eso_, _a**pp**eso_ e _a**rr**eso_.
